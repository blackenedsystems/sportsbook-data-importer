# Sportsbook Data Importer

There are a number of services across the internet that provide data for use in sports betting applications.  This module provides functionality for fetching data from some of those services.  In addition, it provides functionality for integrating this data with Blackened System's sportsbook module, and provides well-defined expansion points for adapting this logic for other sports betting applications.
